        <p>
            <mark>This will be the body of my document. </mark><br>
            A HTML doc starts always with a <em>'!DOCTYPE html'</em>
            element, and then we have a <em>'html'</em> + definition of language to be used in the doc.<br>
            After that we have the <em>'head'</em> element, which will hold the title (necessary), stylesheets, 
            and scripts to run in your webpage. <br>
            After we have the <em>'body'</em> element, that will hold all the parts to be displayed 
            in your webpage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Starting with the definition of <mark>markup</mark>:<br>
            A markup is the way of formatting the appearence or use of your elements on your browzer.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Elements</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
            An <em>'em'</em> inside angle brackets is made to <em>italicize</em> something<br>
            A <strong>'strong'</strong> inside angle brackets is used to make the word <strong>boldface</strong><br>
            'Br' inside angle brackets<br> breaks <br> the line.<br>
            'Br' is a void element: Does not need a end tag.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's try a few other HTML elements:<br>
            This one it called <mark>'mark'</mark>.<br>
            Another one is <sub>'sub'</sub> and <sup>'sup'</sup>.<br>
            We can use more than one type of tags in our text at once.<br>
            Like <em><mark>'em and mark'</mark></em>, be careful nesting them correctly.
        </p>

        <p>
            An element can be a block or inline element.<br>
            A block element create an invisible box with <em>width, height and margin before and after.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            An element is made of tag(s) and content.<br>
            Usually, we have an opening tag, the content and a closing tag.<br>
            Like this: <em> opening tag + content + closing tag</em> <br>
            For some elements the closing tags are optional, like 'li'(list) and 'p'(paragraph).<br>
            This happen because the browser knows there has to be a closing tag before the next
            opening tag for the same element. <br>
            There is no paragraph inside a paragraph.
            <br>
            Some elements does not take any closing tag, like <em>'br'</em>.
        </p>

        <div> 
            A <strong>division</strong> element separate what is inside it in a block, as well as a paragraph element.
            It also creates an invisible box.
        </div>

        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>
            The 'li' element stands for list. A list can be <strong>ordered - 'ol'</strong> 
            or <strong>unordered - 'ul'</strong><br>
            An <mark> unordered list</mark> has bullets (default):
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Books
                <li> Pencil
                <li> Pens
                <li> Notebook
            </ul>
        
            An <mark>ordered list</mark> has numbers (default):
        
            <ol>
                <li> Books
                <li> Pencil
                <li> Pens
                <li> Notebook
            </ol>
        
        We can create a list inside a list, it is called nested list, like this:
            <ul>
                <li>Animals
                    <ol>
                        <li>Dog</li>
                        <li>Horse</li>
                        <li>Cat</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Flowers
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sunflower</li>
                        <li>Roses</li>
                    </ol>
            </ul>

        <h3>Hypertext</h3>

        <p>
            Now let's try to use another reference not only text.<br>
            I will add this link above using the <strong>'a'</strong> element.<br>
            To use an <strong>'a'</strong> element we will need more than just the tag. <br>
            We will need the name and value for the attribute.<br>
            It will be something like 'a href=http://...net'.<br>
            This is my first hypertext in a webpage, and I choose the one I visit the most:<br><br>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ie/" target="_blank"><strong>NETFLIX</strong></a>
        </p>

        <h3>Image</h3>
        <p>
            To add some image to your website it will be needed to add an <strong>'img'</strong> element.<br>
            The <strong>'img'</strong> element takes a source <em>'src'</em> and a <em>'alt'</em> references.<br>
            The <em>'src'</em> reference is the address of the image, and the <em>'alt'</em> is what will be showed
            if the image can't be loaded.<br>
            Here is one picture of one of my favourite games character. I will set the link of it too.<br><br>
